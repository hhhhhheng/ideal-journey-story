It was a rainy day. Winnie the Pooh had decided to spend a whole day sleeping at home.
Suddenly, he heard someone knocking the door.
He was so lazy to get up so he yelled at the door: "Who is this?"
However, the rain was so heavy that Tigger who was stading outside the door couldn't hear what Winnie the Pooh said.

Tigger thought Winnie was not at home, but he had some thing very important to tell
Winnie regarding his honey.Therefore he decided to leave Winnie a massage by leaving a letter at the door. He left after finishing letter. At same time, Winnie thought that maybe the Tigger, but he cannot recognize due to rain.

Then, Winnie was going to visit Tigger. In his way to Tiger's home, he reflecte he still had cs400 program to do.
Winnie is quite worring about his program, but he thought Tigger must have something emegent to tell.
The rain is so heavy, but the friendship is more important for Winnie, so he struggled and spent a whole afternoon in his way to Tigger's home.
Finally, Winnie met Tigger, they were both happy now.
Winnie asked: "what were you going to tell me"
Tigger said: "I just wanted to remind you to finish the cs400 program"
Winnie was happy to hear that, and he looked at his watch: 11:45pm. 

Winnie said, "Oh shoot it is 11:46pm!"
Winnie realized that he had no way to finish his program in 15 minutes, then he dropped the class.
He apparently forgot that his instructor has postponed the due date to tomorrow.
