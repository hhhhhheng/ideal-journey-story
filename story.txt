It was a rainy day. Winnie the Pooh had decided to spend a whole day sleeping at home.
Suddenly, he heard someone knocking the door.
He was so lazy to get up so he yelled at the door: "Who is this?"
However, the rain was so heavy that Tigger who was stading outside the door couldn't hear what Winnie the Pooh said.

Tigger thought Winnie was not at home, but he had some thing very important to tell
Winnie regarding his honey.Therefore he decided to leave Winnie a massage by leaving a letter at the door. He left after finishing letter. At same time, Winnie thought that maybe the Tigger, but he cannot recognize due to rain.
