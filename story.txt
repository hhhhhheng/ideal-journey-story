It was a rainy day. Winnie the Pooh had decided to spend a whole day sleeping at home.
Suddenly, he heard someone knocking the door.
He was so lazy to get up so he yelled at the door: "Who is this?"
However, the rain was so heavy that Tigger who was stading outside the door couldn't hear what Winnie the Pooh said.
